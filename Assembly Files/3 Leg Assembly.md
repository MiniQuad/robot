### Leg Assembly

Plug two batteries into the OpenCM9.04. Open the [SetZeroPosition](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Assembly%20Files/Assembly%20Code/SetZeroPosition.ino) code in the OpenCM IDE. Replace the numbers in the red box below to the numbers of the motors that you are currently assembling a leg on. The leg assembly shown in the instructions below correspond to motors 1 and 2. Upload the code to the OpenCM9.04. 

![2_1MotorZero](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Assembly%20Files/Assembly%20Images/2%20Leg%20Assembly/2_1MotorZero.PNG)

Once the Code is uploaded, the motor should move to the position shown below where the notch on the base of the motor aligns with the notch on the horn of the motor. You can assemble the legs with the batteries and OpenCM9.04 unplugged, but it is recommended to leave them plugged in to prevent the motors from rotating at all during the assembly.

Remove the screws from the XL-320 that hold the servo horn in place (circled below)

Place 4-40 nuts (x2) into 2 of slots on the back of the Motor Hub. Any set of slots will work as long as they are both on the same diagonal of the rectangle formed by the 4 slots present.

![2MotorHubNuts](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Assembly%20Files/Assembly%20Images/2%20Leg%20Assembly/2MotorHubNuts.PNG)

Attach the Motor Hub to the horn of the XL-320. First press the Motor Hub into place. The registration tabs on the Motor Hub should align with the holes on the horn of the XL-320. Snap the tabs into place and fasten the hub onto the motor using an M2.5 x 16mm screw and an M2.5 Washer.

![3AttachMotorHub](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Assembly%20Files/Assembly%20Images/2%20Leg%20Assembly/3AttachMotorHub.PNG)

Place a 4-40 Locknut into the slot on the back of the Motor Hub Connector. Make sure to push the Locknut as far into the connector as possible.

![4MotorHubConnectorLockNut](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Assembly%20Files/Assembly%20Images/2%20Leg%20Assembly/4MotorHubConnectorLockNut.PNG)

Attach the Motor Hub Connector to the Motor Hub using 4-40 x .375" countersunk screws (x2). 

![5MotorHubConnScrews](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Assembly%20Files/Assembly%20Images/2%20Leg%20Assembly/5MotorHubConnScrews.PNG)

Attach the Pulley Brace to the assembly by sliding the smaller hole of the brace onto the Motor Hub Connector.

![6PulleyBrace](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Assembly%20Files/Assembly%20Images/2%20Leg%20Assembly/6PulleyBrace.PNG)

Attach the Thigh Pulley to the assembly following the same steps as the Motor Hub. Align the registration tabs on the Thigh Pulley with the holes on motor 2 and snap it into place. Fasten the pulley to the motor using an M2.5 x 16mm screw and an M2.5 Washer.

![7ThighPulley](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Assembly%20Files/Assembly%20Images/2%20Leg%20Assembly/7ThighPulley.PNG)

Attach the 5.6" Timing Belt and Thigh to the Assembly. Wrap one end of the timing belt around the Thigh. Hold the thigh vertical to the assembly. Wrap the belt around the Thigh Pulley while sliding the thigh onto the Motor Hub Connector. Keep the thigh as vertical as possible during installation. Some deviation will be necessary to engage the timing belt. This will be corrected later during Motor Calibration.

![8ThighAndTimingBelt](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Assembly%20Files/Assembly%20Images/2%20Leg%20Assembly/8ThighAndTimingBelt.PNG)

Attach the Knee Pulley to the assembly by sliding it into the hole on the front of the Thigh. Align the registration tabs on the Knee Pulley to the slots on the Motor Hub Connector. Snap the Knee Pulley into place. The images on the right below depict the assembly with the Knee Pulley fully inserted into the leg assembly. The face of the teeth on the Knee Pulley should be sitting up agains the face of the thigh as seen in the bottom right image. 

![9KneePulley](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Assembly%20Files/Assembly%20Images/2%20Leg%20Assembly/9KneePulley.PNG)

Attach the Knee Cover to the Knee using a 4-40 x .5" countersunk screw and a 4-40 Locknut. Fasten the leg cover into place, but leave it loose enough for the Knee Cover to rotate around the axis of the screw.

![10KneeCover](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Assembly%20Files/Assembly%20Images/2%20Leg%20Assembly/10KneeCover.PNG)

Rotate the Knee Cover to one side enough to allow the 4.4" Timing Belt onto the teeth of the Knee.

![11KneeBelt](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Assembly%20Files/Assembly%20Images/2%20Leg%20Assembly/11KneeBelt.PNG)

Rotate the Knee Cover Back into place. Place the timing belt around the Knee Pulley at the top of the leg assembly. Stretch the Knee and Knee Cover downwards and put a 4-40 x .75" countersunk screw into the back of the Knee. If the fit is too tight, you may need to twist the screw into place. Make sure the back face of the knee is pressing up against the face of the Thigh.

![12AttachKnee](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Assembly%20Files/Assembly%20Images/2%20Leg%20Assembly/12AttachKnee.PNG)

Place the Thigh Cover onto the end of the 4-40 x .75" screw used in the previous step. Tighten it into place with a 4-40 Locknut. Make sure that the screw is not to tight and that the Thigh Cover can be rotated about the screw.

![13ThighCover](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Assembly%20Files/Assembly%20Images/2%20Leg%20Assembly/13ThighCover.PNG)

Push on the bottom of the Knee in the direction and location of the yellow arrow in the image below. Rotated the top of the Thigh Cover into place. If the faces on the Thigh Cover don't sit flush against the faces of the Thigh, you made need to push more on the bottom of the foot. The assembly with flex a little bit, but do not push too hard as you may risk damaging the parts. Once the Thigh Cover is in place, fasten the assembly together using a 4-40 x 1.25" countersunk screw.

![14ThichCoverScrew](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Assembly%20Files/Assembly%20Images/2%20Leg%20Assembly/14ThichCoverScrew.PNG)

Attach the foot to the assembly. Slide the Foot into place and tighten it to the bottom holes od the Knee and Knee Cover using a 4-40 x .50" countersunk screw and a 4-40 Locknut.
