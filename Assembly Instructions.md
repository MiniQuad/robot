# Assembly Instructions

## Acquire and Print Parts

Begin by gathering all of the necessary material to build MiniQuad found in the [Master BOM](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Master%20BOM.md). Print the supplied [STL Files](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/tree/master/STL%20Files) in the quantities listen in the [Master BOM](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Master%20BOM.md). Note that all parts were sliced in the [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/) and printed on a [Prusa MK3S](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/180-original-prusa-i3-mk3s-kit.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwvvj5BRDkARIsAGD9vlIFy3uEIDK6V4373JYZdU8jZu2v4UQswNzl50jHS7kUwZr2Ial2l-0aAnDAEALw_wcB) with a 40% infill. Depending on your slicer settings and 3D Printer, material used for each part can vary.

## Necessary Software

To run the initial set up code as well as program MiniQuad to move, follow the steps to download the [OpenCM IDE](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/opencm_ide/getting_started/) from robotis.
