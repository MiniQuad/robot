# Assembly Instructions

### Acquire and Print Parts

Begin by gathering all of the necessary material to build MiniQuad found in the [Master BOM](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Master%20BOM.md). Print the supplied [STL Files](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/tree/master/STL%20Files) in the quantities listed in the [Master BOM](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Master%20BOM.md). Note that all parts were sliced in the [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/) and printed on a [Prusa MK3S](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/180-original-prusa-i3-mk3s-kit.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwvvj5BRDkARIsAGD9vlIFy3uEIDK6V4373JYZdU8jZu2v4UQswNzl50jHS7kUwZr2Ial2l-0aAnDAEALw_wcB) with a 40% infill. Depending on your slicer settings and 3D Printer, material used for each part can vary. You also may need to edit the parts depending on the tolerances of your 3D printer. SOLIDWORKS files are included in the [CAD](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/tree/master/CAD) folder in case edits are necessary.

### Download OpenCM IDE

While the parts are printing, follow the steps to download the [OpenCM IDE](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/opencm_ide/getting_started/) from robotis. The OpenCM IDE will be necessary to run the initial set up code as well as program MiniQuad to move. 

1: Assign Motor ID's

2: Main Body Assembly

3: Leg Assembly
Follow the Steps in the [Leg Assembly File](https://github.com/MiniQuad/robot/blob/master/Assembly%20Files/3%20Leg%20Assembly.md) to attach and assemble all of the legs on MiniQuad.
